# libft

**libft** is a custom C library that implements standard library functions and additional utility functions for handling strings, memory, and more.

## Description

This project was created as part of the [42](https://www.42.fr/en/) curriculum to improve C programming skills and deepen understanding of how common C functions are implemented.

## Functions

- Memory functions (`memset`, `memcpy`, etc.)
- String functions (`strlen`, `strdup`, `strcpy`, etc.)
- Conversion functions (`itoa`, `atoi`, etc.)

## Usage

To use this library in your C projects, just include `libft.h` and link the compiled `libft.a` library.
